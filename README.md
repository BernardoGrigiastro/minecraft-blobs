# Blobs

Blobs are tiny, dyeable, nameable, placeable entities that can be used in creative ways.

## Crafting

They can be crafted combining slime balls and melon seeds.

## What can I do with blobs?

You can:
   - Place a blob using it on a block and retrieve it by right clicking it (more than one blob can occupy the same space)
   - Dispense blobs using dispensers
   - Dye it just like leather equipment
   - Rename the blob, which will show that name when placed
   - Any damage to a blob will make it drop itself, with the exception of swords

This means you can play most board games, card games, etc. as long as you don't mind everything being blobs.
